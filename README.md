btar
====

btar is a tar-compatible archiver which allows arbitrary compression and
ciphering, redundancy, differential backup, indexed extraction, multicore
compression, input and output serialisation, and tolerance to partial
archive errors.

The original btar program is created and owned by Llu√≠s Batlle i Rossell, and
licensed under the GPLv3 (which you can find in ./LICENSE, as well as the
original tarball). I'm just a mediocre script kiddie who's trying to
make a version of btar that I can submit to the FreeBSD ports tree. (with the
author's permission, of course.)
